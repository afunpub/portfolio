	  <p>To insert an image into the web page, you should first
	  upload it to the remote server.<br><br>
	  <img src="../images/image_upload.gif" width="337" height="167" border="1">	  </p>
	  <p>Write the file's local path
	  or use the <strong>Browse</strong> button to navigate through local folders
	  and select the file.</p>
	  <p>Use the dropdown menu to select some  hardcoded dimensions for the picture.
	  To keep the image's original size, select "Leave Image". You can also choose 
          one of the  predefined resize values or manually edit the values into the fields 
          (by selecting the "Custom" option). The resizing is done by maintaining the aspect 
          ratio, such that the image will fit into a rectangle with the specified dimensions. 
          This means that sometimes, one of the dimensions will have to be recalculated, 
          according to the value of the other.
		You can also activate the "Sharpen" option (not supported by all servers).
					</p>
	  <p>Finally, click the Upload button to confirm your selection.</p>
