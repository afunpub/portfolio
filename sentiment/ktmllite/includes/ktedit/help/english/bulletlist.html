      Select several paragraphs and click on the Bullet List button. KTML3
	      will introduce a bullet in front of each selected paragraph. If at
	    the end of
	  a bulleted paragraph the &quot;Enter&quot; key is pressed, the next line will
	  begin with a bullet. After applying
	  a bullet list, the corresponding button remains activated until the list
	  is unset. All you have to do is to position the cursor into
	  a paragraph and check if the Bullet List button is activated or not. To
	  unset a bullet list, you should click on the Bullet List button to deactivate
	  it.<strong>	  </strong>When the &#8220;Tab&#8221; key is pressed, the paragraph
  is indented and the bullets change their shape.</p>
    <p><strong><font size="2">Note:</font></strong><font size="2"> In Mozilla only, if you apply a bullet list to each paragraph separately,
      the spacing will increase, compared to the situation when the bullet list
    is applied to all selected paragraphs at once.</font></p>
