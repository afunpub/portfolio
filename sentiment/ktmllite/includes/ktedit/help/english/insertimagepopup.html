	  <p>After clicking on the Insert Image button, KTML3 will open a pop-up window
	    to help you select the desired image or to upload a new image to the
	    remote server.</p>
	  <p><strong>Navigating through files</strong><br>
	  The pop-up window contains a file navigator
	    and a configuration area. The file navigator is used to manage the remote
	    application files and folders and to access local files or folders. The
	    file navigator will display and will allow you to upload only the supported
    file types:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <strong>bmp</strong>, <strong>gif</strong>, <strong>jpeg</strong>, <strong>jpg</strong>, <strong>png</strong>, <strong>swf</strong>.</p>
	  <p>        The file navigator has two panels:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>the left panel, which displays the
	          tree structure of the upload folder, and has two buttons: <strong>Make
	    Folder</strong>, <strong>Delete Folder</strong>;
	    <p><img src="../images/folders.gif" width="105" height="45" border="1"></p>	  </li>
	  <li> the right panel, which displays the contents of the current folder
	            (the one selected from the tree) and has two buttons: <strong>Upload
	    Image</strong>, <strong>Delete
	        Image</strong>.
        <p><img src="../images/images.gif" width="207" height="21" border="1"></p>	  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p> The tree structure shows only the structure of the upload folder.
	      You can set the path to this folder when you configure KTML3.</p>
	  <p>        The navigation through the folder structure is done by double-clicking
	            on the name of a folder from the tree. The navigator will then
	            display the selected folder's contents (including other folders,
	        if the case)
	            in the right
	            panel. When you want to go up one level into the folder structure,
	            double-click on the two points icon displayed on top of the folder
	            list.</p>
	  <p>        To see the contents of the root folder (i.e. the upload folder),
	              click on the single point icon from the left panel.<br>
        In the right panel, the folders are displayed on the top, followed
	              by the images. The navigator displays the image name and an
	              image preview. To select
	              an image, you can click either on the preview or on the name. </p>
	  <p><strong>The image configuration area</strong><br>
	    After selecting the desired image by navigating through the upload folder
	      (or uploading a new image to the remote server), you can set additional
	      attributes for that image. These attributes can be accessed from the
	      configuration area below the file navigator.</p>
      <img src="../images/image_insert_conf.gif" width="335" height="157" border="1">
	  <p>For the selected image,
	        you can set:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li><strong> Full URL</strong> &#8211; an alternative to browsing to the picture using the file navigator.
  This is set automatically when you choose a file;</li>
	  <li>	    <strong>Alternative text </strong>&#8211; this text will be displayed by browsers that do not
  support images. In the most common browsers, this text also appears when the
  pointer is over the image;</li>
	  <li><strong> Alignment </strong>&#8211; specifies the position of the picture relative to the other
  page elements. The available options are: Default, Left, Right, Top, Middle,Bottom;</li>
	  <li><strong> Border Thickness </strong>&#8211; enter a value in pixels if you want to display a border
  around your picture. The default value is 0, that is, no border will be displayed.</li>
	  <li><strong> Width </strong>&amp; <strong>Height </strong>&#8211; the dimensions of the picture. To keep the image's
  original size, leave these fields to their default values. You can also resize
  the picture later, after it has been inserted in the page, by selecting it
  and dragging the resize handles.</li>
  </ul>
	  <p>        These properties can also be configured later in the Image Inspector
	        that is displayed when selecting the inserted picture.<br><br>
            <font size="2">        <strong>Note:</strong> You can also resize
            the selected picture to a greater size than the original one, but
            the quality of the image will visibly deteriorate.</font></p>
	  <p>To confirm
            your settings and to insert the image into the page, click the OK
            button.</p>
	  <p><strong>Creating a new folder</strong><br>
	    You can create new folders on the remote server, in order to better organize
	      the uploaded pictures. To do that, click on the Make Directory button
	      and enter the folder name in the dialog window.<br>
	    The newly created directory is automatically inserted in the navigation
	    tree. To view the contents of a certain folder, click on its name from the
	    navigation tree in the left panel. Its contents will be displayed in the
	    right panel. (The right panel is empty because the folder you have just
    created does not contain any files).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
	  <p><strong>Deleting a folder</strong><br>
	    You can delete an existing folder by selecting it from the navigation
	    tree and clicking on the Delete Folder button. A pop-window appears, asking
    for confirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
	  <p><strong>Replacing an Image</strong><br>

	    the picture that you want to replace and then  click on the
