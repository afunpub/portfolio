	    The font size can be changed by selecting the desired
	  size from the dropdown menu available in the toolbar. The size change can
	  affect the selected text or the text entered afterwards if no text selection
	  has been made. By default, the text size is set to 14px. The text sizes are
	  similar to the ones used by the most common word processors (Microsoft Word,
	  OpenOffice).</p>
	  <p>        The current font size will be autoselected from the dropdown. To
	    see what size a specific text is, simply select that text or click inside
	        it. However,
	    if a text selection has more than one font size applied, a certain size
      will no longer be displayed in the dropdown.</p>
	  <p> When changing the size of a text selection that has multiple sizes applied,
      they will all be replaced by the new size. </p>
