	    The Numbered List feature is very similar to the Bullet
	  List one. This feature is available by clicking on the Numbered List button.
	  KTML3 will introduce a number, in ascending order, in front of each selected
	    paragraph. If at the end of a numbered paragraph the Enter key is pressed,
	    KTML3 will
	  begin a new numbered paragraph.<br><br>
	  <font size="2"><strong>Note:</strong>  In Mozilla only, if you apply a numbered
	    list to each paragraph separately, instead of applying it to a selection
	    of several
	  paragraphs, the numbering will be reset, i.e. each paragraph number is
    set to 1.</font>	  </p>
	  <p>        After applying a numbered list, the corresponding button remains activated
	    until the list is unset. To check if the Numbered List is activated or
      not, place the mouse cursor inside the corresponding paragraph.</p>
	  <p>To unset a numbered list, you should click on the Numbered List button
	    to deactivate it.<br>
	    If you position the cursor inside a single paragraph and deactivate the
	    Numbered List button, that paragraph will have no number in front of
	    it; a new list will start right below it. Therefore, the numbering is reset
	    and
    the following paragraph number is set to 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </p>
	  <p>When the Tab key is pressed while the cursor is inside one paragraph,
	    that paragraph will be indented and its number will change into 1. The
	    number of
	    the following paragraph is decremented by 1. This way, you can obtain
	    nested lists. When the Tab key is pressed while having several paragraphs
	    selected,
    they will be indented, but their numbers will remain the same.</p>
