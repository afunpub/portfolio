	  You can insert images into your web pages using the Insert
	  Image button. After pressing this button, a pop-up window will be displayed,
	    to help you select the desired picture from the remote server, or to
	    upload a new one. You can upload pictures from your local server to
	    the remote one. An upload folder
	    is
	    created on the
	    remote
	    server.
	    You can insert images
	  from the upload folder into the KTML3 editable area. Even if the images
	    are deleted from the site pages, the files will remain on the remote
	    server until
  you delete them from the upload folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </div>
