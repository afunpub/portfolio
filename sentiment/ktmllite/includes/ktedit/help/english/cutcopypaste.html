	  <p><strong>Cut</strong><br>
	  This command operates on the selected text/image. After executing it, the
	    selected text/image is removed from the document (cut) and placed into
	    the Clipboard from where it can be pasted either into the KTML3 Editable
	    Region
    or into another editor. The command is accessible through the Cut button
    or by using the shortcut keys                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &#8220;Ctrl+X&#8221;.<br>
