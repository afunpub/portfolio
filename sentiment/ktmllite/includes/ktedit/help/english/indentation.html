	    KTML3 also includes an indentation function that means increasing
	    the distance between the paragraph and the left page margin. The indent
	    size was defined
	    in KTML3 and it cannot be changed by the user. To indent a selected paragraph,
	    use the Indent button from the KTML3 toolbar.<br>
	  Each time you click on the Indent button, the left margin will increase.</p>
	  
	    <strong>Text Outdent</strong><br>
	    This command will execute the exact reverse operation of Indent. It decreases
	    the left margin each time the Outdent button is clicked. This command
	    can be applied only if an Indent command has been executed before-hand. </p>
