	  When inserting one or more paragraphs already formatted
	  by another word processor (say, Microsoft Word or OpenOffice), the size of
	  the HTML code could increase considerably. This phenomenon is due to the export
	  methods used by the two applications, that insert into the HTML code many
	  and mostly useless HTML tags. The KTML3 users have the option to clean the
	  text of these tags by using the &quot;Clean HTML Code&quot; option, and then
	  use the KTML3 format functions. The result is a cleaner and more accurate
  code. <BR><BR>
          <STRONG>Caution: </STRONG>Pay attention when using the "Clean HTML Content" feature, 
          because it affects all the code in your page. This option will not only clean any text 
          which is formatted with another word processor, but will also remove all the previously 
          applied CSS styles for your page content. We recommend the user to do all the cleaning 
          code operations he might need before setting CSS styles to his page, in order to prevent 
          wasting time on text reformatting. However, the Undo option can be used in any moment.
