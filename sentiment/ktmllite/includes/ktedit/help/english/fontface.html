	    The KTML3 editor allows you to change fonts by selecting
	  the desired font from the dropdown menu available in the toolbar. By default,
	  the font style is Times New Roman, Times, serif. </p>
	  <p>A very useful KTML3 feature
	    is the autoselection of the current font. That means that you can easily
	    find out what font a particular word or text has
	    just by selecting it or by positioning the cursor inside it.
	    If a text with more than one font applied is selected, a font will no
	    longer be displayed in the dropdown.
	    When changing the font of selection that has multiple fonts applied,
    all the text will be set to have the new selected font.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
	  <p>When a CSS containing reference to new fonts is imported
      into the document, those new styles will appear in the dropdown menu.</p>
