	<div class="content">	  
	  <p>You can create links to files stored on the remote
	  server. After you press on the &quot;Browse for File&quot; button
	    displayed in the Link Inspector panel, 
	  KTML  opens a pop-up window very similar to the one used for inserting
	  images. The window is composed of three panels:</p>
	  <ul>
	  <li>        the left panel, which displays the tree structure of the upload
	    folder, and has two buttons: <strong>Make Folder</strong>, <strong>Delete
	    Folder</strong>;
	    <p><img src="../images/folders.gif" width="105" height="45" border="1"></p>	  </li>
	  <li>        the right panel, which displays the contents of the current folder
	        (the one selected from the tree) and has two buttons: <strong>Upload
	        File</strong>,
        <strong>Delete File</strong>;
        <p><img src="../images/files.gif" width="206" height="22" border="1"></p>	  </li>
	  <li>the bottom panel, which helps you configure the link.
	    <p><img src="../images/file_conf.gif" width="193" height="48" border="1"></p>	  </li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>The file navigator
	      will display only the supported file types: <strong>bmp,
	      gif, jpeg, jpg, png, pdf, doc, rtf, txt, mp3, mpg, mpeg,
          avi, wav, mov, qt, rm.</strong></p>
	  
	  <p>The File Navigator behavior is similar to the one used to upload
	          images. You can navigate through the folder structure, create/delete
	            folders,
	            upload/delete/ files. For a selected file, you must choose the
            target window.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
